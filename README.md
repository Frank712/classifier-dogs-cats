# CNN to classifier dogs and cats

This is a implementation of a convolutional neural network to extract the characteristics
of the dogs and cats, and classifier.

This CNN is composed of:
- One layer to Convolution 2D
- One layer to MaxPooling 2D
- One mechanism to Flatten the previous layers
- One mechanism to fitting the training and test sets.

## Requirements

- Theano
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Python 2.7
